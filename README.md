# K-Means_Clustering_Project
Using a unsupervised learning algorithm called K-means clustering to analyse data and separate them into different groups.

## Benefits and Shortcomings of K-means Clustering
### Advantages
K-Means is known for being a relatively simple algorithm, not too complex to implement. This
is because it uses only a distance-calculation method (Euclidean distance usually) and the data
set. The algorithm is also suitable for large data sets, being faster than other methods (such as
hierarchical algorithms). This can be proved by considering K-means time complexity, which is
linear, compared to other clustering methods

| Clustering Method | Time Complexity | Notations |
| K-means | O(n*k*l) = O(n) | n- no. of samples, k = no. of clusters, l= no. of iterations |
